Polycomp
========

This package provides a set of Python bindings to the libpolycomp
library, as well as a stand-alone program which can be used to
compress/decompress FITS files into polycomp files (still FITS files
in disguise).

Requirements
------------

1. Either Python 2.7 or 3.4 will work

2. Libpolycomp (https://github.com/ziotom78/libpolycomp) must already
   be installed

3. The following Python libraries are required:
   - `click` (http://click.pocoo.org/5/);
   - `numpy` (http://www.numpy.org/);
   - Either `astropy` (version 0.4 or greater, http://www.astropy.org/) or
     `pyfits` (http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits). (The
     `setup.py` script installs Astropy.)

**Note**: Recent versions of NumPy (1.10) seem to be incompatible with PyFits
3.3: saving files will lead to strange assertion errors. NumPy 1.8.2 and PyFits
3.3 are fine.

Basic usage
-----------

To use the bindings in your code, simply import ``pypolycomp`` in your
project::

  import pypolycomp

This package provides also a standalone program, ``polycomp``. Use the
``--help`` flag to get some help about how to use it::

  $ polycomp --help
